## Workflow

- On Github, “fork” the GMLC-1-4-2 repository to one of your own (if your github registration name is ‘jeff’, you’d fork GMLC-1-4-2/battery_interface to jeff/battery_interface).
- On your own computer, “clone” the github jeff/battery_interface repository to your local disk.
- On your own computer, edit, save, commit…
- Push your edits from your local computer up to jeff/battery_interface on github.
- On Github, send a “pull request” to get your latest jeff/battery_interface changes incorporated into the main GMLC-1-4-2/battery_interface repository.
